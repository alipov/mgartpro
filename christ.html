              went from 70 to 95 percent capacity. From 2009 to 2018, they performed a world-premiere
              performance in every subscription concert and collaborated regularly with contemporary
              music ensembles Court-Circuit Paris and Ensemble Mosaik Berlin. The high quality of the
